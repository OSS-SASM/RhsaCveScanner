The problem is caused by the return value `rc,` which is initialized to SSH_ERROR and later rewritten to save the return value of the function call `pki_key_check_hash_compatible.` The value of the variable is not changed between this point and the cryptographic verification.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.\n\nThe maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.\n\nMoreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.\n\nThe maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.\n\nMoreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact.

This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. \n            STATEMENT: Keeping Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 with Moderate severity, because required patch 158b515f703e (see reference) missed. However, currently Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 not affected, because previous patch not backported too: 766b0515d5be (\"net: make sure devices go through netdev_wait_all_refs\"). Means that it is not possible to trigger the issue for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, but potentially Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 could be vulnerable in future, so still need to fix. For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 9 there is known way to reproduce the issue.\n            MITIGATION: To mitigate this issue, prevent the tun module from being loaded.

When using the XML Reader interface with DTD validation and XInclude expansion enabled, processing crafted XML documents can lead to an xmlValidatePopElement use-after-free. \n            STATEMENT: The severity of this vulnerability is not important but moderate due to the lack of impact to both confidentiality and integrity, but potential impact to availability. The theoretical risk of impact to availability is limited due to the specific requirement that applications must continue to misuse the reader API after it has already reported validation errors instead of handling those errors. The flaw requires that crafted XML documents can be provided by an attacker and the utilization of DTD validation and XInclude expansion using the XMLReader API. Along with those conditions, the application using the XMLReader API must be ignoring errors when expanding invalid XInclude nodes in an maliciously crafted document. These conditions are unlikely to exist in the intended usage of the XMLReader API.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

If Curl is unable to resolve the address itself, it passes the hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy. However, the maximum length of the hostname that can be passed is 255 bytes. If the hostname is longer, then Curl switches to the local name resolving and passes the resolved address only to the proxy. The local variable that instructs Curl to \"let the host resolve the name\" could obtain the wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, resulting in the too-long hostname being copied to the target buffer instead of the resolved address, which was not the intended behavior. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw does not affect the versions of curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8.\n\nAn overflow is only possible in applications that do not set `CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE`, or set it smaller than approximately 65kB. Since the curl tool sets `CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE` to 100kB by default, it is not vulnerable unless rate limiting was set by the user to a size smaller than 65kB.\n\nKnowledgebase article:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/7045099\n            MITIGATION: To avoid this issue, we recommend you do not use `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME` proxies with curl. Also do not set a proxy environment variable to socks5h://",

If Curl is unable to resolve the address itself, it passes the hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy. However, the maximum length of the hostname that can be passed is 255 bytes. If the hostname is longer, then Curl switches to the local name resolving and passes the resolved address only to the proxy. The local variable that instructs Curl to \"let the host resolve the name\" could obtain the wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, resulting in the too-long hostname being copied to the target buffer instead of the resolved address, which was not the intended behavior. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw does not affect the versions of curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8.\n\nAn overflow is only possible in applications that do not set `CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE`, or set it smaller than approximately 65kB. Since the curl tool sets `CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE` to 100kB by default, it is not vulnerable unless rate limiting was set by the user to a size smaller than 65kB.\n\nKnowledgebase article:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/7045099\n            MITIGATION: To avoid this issue, we recommend you do not use `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME` proxies with curl.

For example, an attacker could disable the ping extension and thus disable the new countermeasure in OpenSSH 9.5 against keystroke timing attacks. \n            STATEMENT: This CVE is classified as moderate because the attack requires an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) who can intercept and modify the connection's traffic at the TCP/IP layer.\n\nAlthough the attack is cryptographically innovative, its security impact is fortunately quite limited. It only allows the deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this protocol stage prevents user authentication from proceeding, leading to a stalled connection.\n\nThe most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke timing obfuscation features. However, there is no other observable impact on session secrecy or session integrity.\n            MITIGATION: Update to the last version and check that client and server provide kex pseudo-algorithms indicating usage of the updated version of the protocol which is protected from the attack. If \"kex-strict-c-v00@openssh.com\" is provided by clients and \"kex-strict-s-v00@openssh.com\" is in the server's reply, no other steps are necessary.\n\nDisabling ciphers if necessary:\n\nIf \"kex-strict-c-v00@openssh.com\" is not provided by clients or \"kex-strict-s-v00@openssh.com\" is absent in the server's reply, you can disable the following ciphers and HMACs as a workaround on RHEL-8 and RHEL-9:\n\n1. chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\n2. hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com\n3. hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com\n4. hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com\n5. hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com\n\nTo do that through crypto-policies, one can apply a subpolicy with the following content:\n```\ncipher@SSH = -CHACHA20-POLY1305\nssh_etm = 0\n```\ne.g., by putting these lines into `/etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/CVE-2023-48795.pmod`, applying the resulting subpolicy with `update-crypto-policies --set $(update-crypto-policies --show):CVE-2023-48795` and restarting openssh server.\n\nOne can verify that the changes are in effect by ensuring the ciphers listed above are missing from both `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config` and `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config`.\n\nFor more details on using crypto-policies, please refer to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening\n\nNote that this procedure does limit the interoperability of the host and is only suggested as a temporary mitigation until the issue is fully resolved with an update.\n\nFor RHEL-7: \nWe can recommend to use strict MACs and Ciphers on RHEL7 in both files /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n\nBelow strict set of Ciphers and MACs can be used as mitigation for RHEL 7.\n\n```\nCiphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com\nMACs umac-64@openssh.com,umac-128@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512\n```\n\n- For Openshift Container Platform 4:\nPlease refer the KCS[1] document for verifying the fix in RHCOS.\n\n[1] https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7071748",

When a cgroup is being destroyed, cgroup_rstat_flush() is only called at css_release_work_fn(), which is called when the blkcg reference count reaches 0. This circular dependency will prevent blkcg and some blkgs from being freed after they are made offline. This issue may allow an attacker with a local access to cause system instability, such as an out of memory error. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw affects RHEL 8.6 and above, and RHEL9.2 and above.

If the catchall element is garbage-collected when the pipapo set is removed, the element can be deactivated twice. This can cause a use-after-free issue on an NFT_CHAIN object or NFT_OBJECT object, allowing a local unprivileged user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to escalate their privileges on the system. \n            STATEMENT: The upstream commit that introduced this flaw (5f68718b34a5 \"netfilter: nf_tables: GC transaction API to avoid race with control plane\") is not included in any shipped kernel releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8.\n\nOnly local users with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability or root can trigger this issue. \nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux, local unprivileged users can exploit unprivileged user namespaces (CONFIG_USER_NS) to grant themselves this capability.\n\nThe OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) control planes or master machines are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) that consists primarily of RHEL components, therefore, it is also affected by this kernel vulnerability. A successful exploit needs necessary privileges (CAP_NET_ADMIN) and direct, local access. A local user in RHCOS is already a root with full permissions, hence existence of this vulnerability does not bring any value from the potential attacker perspective. From the OpenShift containers perspective, this vulnerability cannot be exploited as in OpenShift the cluster processes on the node are namespaced, which means that switching the namespace in the running OpenShift container will not bring necessary capabilities.\nThis means that for OpenShift, the impact of this vulnerability is Low.\n\nSimilar to the CVE-2023-32233 vulnerability, this has been explained in the following blog post as an example of a \"Container escape vulnerability\":\nhttps://www.redhat.com/en/blog/containers-vulnerability-risk-assessment\n            MITIGATION: In order to trigger the issue, it requires the ability to create user/net namespaces.\n\nOn non-containerized deployments of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, you can disable user namespaces by setting user.max_user_namespaces to 0:\n\n# echo \"user.max_user_namespaces=0\" > /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\n# sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\n\nOn containerized deployments, such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, do not use this mitigation as the functionality is needed to be enabled.",

If the module cannot be disabled, on non-containerized deployments of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the mitigation is to disable user namespaces:\n```\n# echo \"user.max_user_namespaces=0\" > /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\n# sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\n```\nOn containerized deployments, such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, do not use the second mitigation (disabling user namespaces) as the user namespaces are required for container functionality.

The tls_decrypt_sg() function doesn't take references on the pages from clear_skb, so the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done() releases them and a use-after-free can be triggered in process_rx_list when trying to read from the partially-read skb. This issue could lead to a denial of service condition or code execution. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are not affected by this CVE as they did not include kernel TLS support (upstream commit 3c4d755). Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected as it did not include the upstream commit that introduced this flaw (fd31f39 \"tls: rx: decrypt into a fresh skb\").\n            MITIGATION: No current mitigation is available for this vulnerability.

Specifically, the issue arises when a cache hit occurs concurrently with an operation that invalidates the cache, such as a DISCARD ITS command. The root cause is traced to vgic_its_check_cache() not appropriately managing the reference count of the vgic_irq object. Upon returning from this function, the reference count of vgic_irq is not incremented. This issue can lead to the object being prematurely freed while still in use by other parts of the system, potentially resulting in undefined behavior or system instability. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability is assessed as having a Moderate severity due to its potential to cause system instability or undefined behavior under specific conditions. Specifically, the issue arises from concurrent operations involving the LPI translation cache and commands that invalidate this cache, such as DISCARD ITS commands. The root cause lies in vgic_its_check_cache() failing to increment the reference count of the vgic_irq object before releasing the lock. This oversight can lead to a use-after-free scenario where the object may be prematurely freed while still in use elsewhere in the system. As a consequence, if the object is accessed or modified after being freed, it can result in unpredictable behavior, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the timing of cache invalidation and subsequent accesses.\n            MITIGATION: No mitigation is currently available for this vulnerability.

On the other hand,\ncreate_flow_handle tries hard to find and reference already existing\nidentical rules instead of creating new ones.\n\nThese two behaviors can result in a situation where create_flow_handle\n1) creates a new rule and references it, then\n2) in a subsequent step during the same handle creation references it\n   again,\nresulting in a rule with a refcount of 2 that is not linked into the\ntree, will have a NULL parent and root and will result in a crash when\nthe flow group is deleted because del_sw_hw_rule, invoked on rule\ndeletion, assumes node->parent is != NULL.\n\nThis happened in the wild, due to another bug related to incorrect\nhandling of duplicate pkt_reformat ids, which lead to the code in\ncreate_flow_handle incorrectly referencing a just-added rule in the same\nflow handle, resulting in the problem described above.

The memory itself of such item is not freed thanks to RCU\nbut nothing guarantees the actual content of the memory is sane.\n\nIn particular, the reference count can be zero. This can happen if\nipv6_del_addr is called in parallel. ipv6_del_addr removes the entry\nfrom inet6_addr_lst (hlist_del_init_rcu(&ifp->addr_lst)) and drops all\nreferences (__in6_ifa_put(ifp) + in6_ifa_put(ifp)). With bad enough\ntiming, this can happen:\n\n1. In ipv6_get_ifaddr, hlist_for_each_entry_rcu returns an entry.\n\n2. Then, the whole ipv6_del_addr is executed for the given entry. The\n   reference count drops to zero and kfree_rcu is scheduled.\n\n3. ipv6_get_ifaddr continues and tries to increments the reference count\n   (in6_ifa_hold).\n\n4. The rcu is unlocked and the entry is freed.\n\n5. The freed entry is returned.\n\nPrevent increasing of the reference count in such case. The name\nin6_ifa_hold_safe is chosen to mimic the existing fib6_info_hold_safe.\n\n[   41.506330] refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.\n[   41.506760] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 595 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate+0xa5/0x130\n[   41.507413] Modules linked in: veth bridge stp llc\n[   41.507821] CPU: 0 PID: 595 Comm: python3 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc2.main-00208-g49563be82afa #14\n[   41.508479] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)\n[   41.509163] RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0xa5/0x130\n[   41.509586] Code: ad ff 90 0f 0b 90 90 c3 cc cc cc cc 80 3d c0 30 ad 01 00 75 a0 c6 05 b7 30 ad 01 01 90 48 c7 c7 38 cc 7a 8c e8 cc 18 ad ff 90 <0f> 0b 90 90 c3 cc cc cc cc 80 3d 98 30 ad 01 00 0f 85 75 ff ff ff\n[   41.510956] RSP: 0018:ffffbda3c026baf0 EFLAGS: 00010282\n[   41.511368] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff9e9c46914800 RCX: 0000000000000000\n[   41.511910] RDX: ffff9e9c7ec29c00 RSI: ffff9e9c7ec1c900 RDI: ffff9e9c7ec1c900\n[   41.512445] RBP: ffff9e9c43660c9c R08: 0000000000009ffb R09: 00000000ffffdfff\n[   41.512998] R10: 00000000ffffdfff R11: ffffffff8ca58a40 R12: ffff9e9c4339a000\n[   41.513534] R13: 0000000000000001 R14: ffff9e9c438a0000 R15: ffffbda3c026bb48\n[   41.514086] FS:  00007fbc4cda1740(0000) GS:ffff9e9c7ec00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[   41.514726] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[   41.515176] CR2: 000056233b337d88 CR3: 000000000376e006 CR4: 0000000000370ef0\n[   41.515713] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n[   41.516252] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n[   41.516799] Call Trace:\n[   41.517037]  <TASK>\n[   41.517249]  ? __warn+0x7b/0x120\n[   41.517535]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xa5/0x130\n[   41.517923]  ? report_bug+0x164/0x190\n[   41.518240]  ? handle_bug+0x3d/0x70\n[   41.518541]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x17/0x70\n[   41.520972]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n[   41.521325]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xa5/0x130\n[   41.521708]  ipv6_get_ifaddr+0xda/0xe0\n[   41.522035]  inet6_rtm_getaddr+0x342/0x3f0\n[   41.522376]  ? __pfx_inet6_rtm_getaddr+0x10/0x10\n[   41.522758]  rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x334/0x3d0\n[   41.523102]  ? netlink_unicast+0x30f/0x390\n[   41.523445]  ? __pfx_rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x10/0x10\n[   41.523832]  netlink_rcv_skb+0x53/0x100\n[   41.524157]  netlink_unicast+0x23b/0x390\n[   41.524484]  netlink_sendmsg+0x1f2/0x440\n[   41.524826]  __sys_sendto+0x1d8/0x1f0\n[   41.525145]  __x64_sys_sendto+0x1f/0x30\n[   41.525467]  do_syscall_64+0xa5/0x1b0\n[   41.525794]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x72/0x7a\n[   41.526213] RIP: 0033:0x7fbc4cfcea9a\n[   41.526528] Code: d8 64 89 02 48 c7 c0 ff ff ff ff eb b8 0f 1f 00 f3 0f 1e fa 41 89 ca 64 8b 04 25 18 00 00 00 85 c0 75 15 b8 2c 00 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 7e c3 0f 1f 44 00 00 41 54 48 83 ec 30 44 89\n[   41.527942] RSP: 002b:00007f\n---truncated---",

In the unlikely event that this happens, the code\nasserts a BUG_ON, and in the case that the kernel is not configured to\ncrash on panic returns a junk event pointer from the empty event list\ncausing things to spiral from there. This BUG_ON is a historical artifact\nof the ibmvfc driver first being upstreamed, and it is well known now that\nthe use of BUG_ON is bad practice except in the most unrecoverable\nscenario.

Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())\n   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error\n   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.\n   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,\n   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).\n\n2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another\n   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index\n   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index\n   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because\n   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number\nis not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.\n\n[phillip@squashfs.org.uk: whitespace fix]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240409204723.446925-1-phillip@squashfs.org.uk",

The issue arises from a race condition where a partially initialized socket with specific permissions carrying SCM_RIGHTS is improperly handled during garbage collection. This situation leads to an incorrect count of active sockets, potentially causing resources to remain unaccounted for and never released. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates the security impact of this vulnerability as Moderate due to the worst-case scenario resulting in a resource consumption attack. Considering this is a timing attack and is hard to replicate outside of very controlled environments, the vulnerability is not rated higher.\n            MITIGATION: There are no known mitigations to this issue and updating to the latest Linux kernel version is recommended to address this vulnerability\u200b.",

This issue occurs in the nft_set_rbtree. rbtree lazy gc on insert, which might collect an end interval element just added in a transaction and skip the end interval elements not yet active. \n            \n            MITIGATION: 1. This flaw can be mitigated by preventing the affected netfilter (nf_tables) kernel module from being loaded. For instructions on how to blacklist a kernel module, please see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278.\n\n2. If the module cannot be disabled, on non-containerized deployments of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the mitigation is to disable user namespaces:\n```\n# echo \"user.max_user_namespaces=0\" > /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\n# sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/userns.conf\n```\nOn containerized deployments such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, do not use the second mitigation (disabling user namespaces) as the functionality is needed to be enabled. The first mitigation (blacklisting nf_tables) is still viable for containerized deployments, providing the environment is not using netfilter.",

During this process, blocks that are already marked as free can be incorrectly marked as free again, leading to the corruption of the buddy bitmap, which is used to track free and allocated blocks. This corruption can result in filesystem inconsistencies and potential data loss. The issue is resolved by reintroducing the mb_regenerate_buddy() function, which regenerates the buddy bitmap to ensure its integrity. \n            STATEMENT: CVE-2024-26601 is considered a Moderate severity issue because its impact is limited to specific conditions during the fast commit replay process of the ext4 filesystem. The vulnerability involves the marking of already free blocks as free, which leads to buddy bitmap corruption. However, this scenario is relatively rare and typically occurs only under certain workload patterns. Additionally, the corruption affects internal filesystem metadata rather than user data directly, reducing the immediate risk of data loss or system compromise. The issue can be mitigated by regenerating the buddy bitmap, and standard filesystem integrity checks and recovery procedures can often address any inconsistencies that arise.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

Each port including the endpoint port is attached to the\ncxl_port driver.\n\nGiven that setup, it follows that when either any port in that lineage\ngoes through a cxl_port ->remove() event, or the memdev goes through a\ncxl_mem ->remove() event. The hierarchy below the removed port, or the\nentire hierarchy if the memdev is removed needs to come down.\n\nThe delete_endpoint() callback is careful to check whether it is being\ncalled to tear down the hierarchy, or if it is only being called to\nteardown the memdev because an ancestor port is going through\n->remove().\n\nThat care needs to take the device_lock() of the endpoint's parent.\nWhich requires 2 bugs to be fixed:\n\n1/ A reference on the parent is needed to prevent use-after-free\n   scenarios like this signature:\n\n    BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#0, kworker/u56:0/11\n    Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS edk2-20230524-3.fc38 05/24/2023\n    Workqueue: cxl_port detach_memdev [cxl_core]\n    RIP: 0010:spin_bug+0x65/0xa0\n    Call Trace:\n      do_raw_spin_lock+0x69/0xa0\n     __mutex_lock+0x695/0xb80\n     delete_endpoint+0xad/0x150 [cxl_core]\n     devres_release_all+0xb8/0x110\n     device_unbind_cleanup+0xe/0x70\n     device_release_driver_internal+0x1d2/0x210\n     detach_memdev+0x15/0x20 [cxl_core]\n     process_one_work+0x1e3/0x4c0\n     worker_thread+0x1dd/0x3d0\n\n2/ In the case of RCH topologies, the parent device that needs to be\n   locked is not always @port->dev as returned by cxl_mem_find_port(), use\n   endpoint->dev.parent instead.",

This vulnerability affects the ath9k wireless driver in the Linux kernel, specifically used with ath9k_htc devices. The issue arises from a race condition where certain initialization processes are incomplete when the system begins handling WiFi-related events. The problem occurs because the device is exposed to the USB subsystem before the ath9k driver finishes initializing critical data structures.\nThis can lead to NULL pointer dereferences, which cause system crashes, particularly when running specific commands or handling events during WiFi operations. A partial fix had been applied earlier to prevent one aspect of this issue, but further problems were identified. The final resolution was to delay all event handling in the ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() function until initialization is fully complete, ensuring stability.",

This issue allows operations such as efi-updatevar to be executed, which leads to a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This crash occurs because the callback for SetVariable is not assigned, causing a level 0 translation fault. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as Moderate severity because it requires specific conditions to be exploited: the system must be using a firmware that does not support the SetVariable function at runtime, and an attacker must have the ability to remount the efivarfs filesystem with read-write permissions. While it does not provide direct unauthorized access or code execution, the resulting crash from a NULL pointer dereference can cause denial of service, disrupting normal system operations.

Unfortunately, the CoCo threat model means that the\nVM host cannot be trusted and may actively work against guests to\nextract secrets or manipulate computation. Since a malicious host can\nmodify or observe nearly all inputs to guests, the only remaining source\nof entropy for CoCo guests is RDRAND.\n\nIf RDRAND is broken -- due to CPU hardware fault -- the RNG as a whole\nis meant to gracefully continue on gathering entropy from other sources,\nbut since there aren't other sources on CoCo, this is catastrophic.\nThis is mostly a concern at boot time when initially seeding the RNG, as\nafter that the consequences of a broken RDRAND are much more\ntheoretical.\n\nSo, try at boot to seed the RNG using 256 bits of RDRAND output. If this\nfails, panic(). This will also trigger if the system is booted without\nRDRAND, as RDRAND is essential for a safe CoCo boot.\n\nAdd this deliberately to be \"just a CoCo x86 driver feature\" and not\npart of the RNG itself. Many device drivers and platforms have some\ndesire to contribute something to the RNG, and add_device_randomness()\nis specifically meant for this purpose.\n\nAny driver can call it with seed data of any quality, or even garbage\nquality, and it can only possibly make the quality of the RNG better or\nhave no effect, but can never make it worse.\n\nRather than trying to build something into the core of the RNG, consider\nthe particular CoCo issue just a CoCo issue, and therefore separate it\nall out into driver (well, arch/platform) code.\n\n  [ bp: Massage commit message. ]",

Commit\nfb6791d100d1b started exploiting this behavior to speed up filesystem\nunmount: gfs2 would simply free glocks it didn't want to unlock and then\nrelease the lockspace.  This didn't take the bast callbacks for\nasynchronous lock contention notifications into account, which remain\nactive until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace is released.\n\nTo prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects, put the\nglocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list, release\nthe lockspace, and only then free those glocks.\n\nAs an additional measure, ignore unexpected ast and bast callbacks if\nthe receiving glock is dead. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is rated as a moderate severity due to its localized impact.

The solution was to replace the sock_sock lock with the sk_receive_queue.lock in the bt_sock_ioctl function to prevent a use-after-free (UAF) condition and avoid the deadlock. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw has been rated as having a Moderate impact because it is believed to be difficult to exploit and cannot be used to achieve local privilege escalation.",

In macvlan case, macvlan driver retains clone(s) of the mcast skb\n    and schedules a work queue to send them out on the lower devices.\n\n    The clone skb->_nfct is not a copy, it is the same entry as the\n    original skb.  The macvlan rx handler then returns RX_HANDLER_PASS.\n 5. Normal conntrack hooks (in NF_INET_LOCAL_IN) confirm the orig skb.\n\nThe Macvlan broadcast worker and normal confirm path will race.\n\nThis race will not happen if step 2 already confirmed a clone. In that\ncase later steps perform skb_clone() with skb->_nfct already confirmed (in\nhash table).  This works fine.\n\nBut such confirmation won't happen when eb/ip/nftables rules dropped the\npackets before they reached the nf_confirm step in postrouting.\n\nPablo points out that nf_conntrack_bridge doesn't allow use of stateful\nnat, so we can safely discard the nf_conn entry and let inet call\nconntrack again.\n\nThis doesn't work for bridge netfilter: skb could have a nat\ntransformation. Also bridge nf prevents re-invocation of inet prerouting\nvia 'sabotage_in' hook.\n\nWork around this problem by explicit confirmation of the entry at LOCAL_IN\ntime, before upper layer has a chance to clone the unconfirmed entry.\n\nThe downside is that this disables NAT and conntrack helpers.\n\nAlternative fix would be to add locking to all code parts that deal with\nunconfirmed packets, but even if that could be done in a sane way this\nopens up other problems, for example:\n\n-m physdev --physdev-out eth0 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.4\n-m physdev --physdev-out eth1 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.5\n\nFor multicast case, only one of such conflicting mappings will be\ncreated, conntrack only handles 1:1 NAT mappings.\n\nUsers should set create a setup that explicitly marks such traffic\nNOTRACK (conntrack bypass) to avoid this, but we cannot auto-bypass\nthem, ruleset might have accept rules for untracked traffic already,\nso user-visible behaviour would change.",

However, the 'ipv6' is a union that shares\nthe space between 'nd' and 'ct_orig' that holds the original tuple\nconntrack metadata parsed from the OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY.\n\nND packets should not normally have conntrack state, so it's fine to\nshare the space, but normal ICMPv6 Echo packets or maybe other types of\nICMPv6 can have the state attached and it should not be overwritten.\n\nThe issue results in all but the last 4 bytes of the destination\naddress being wiped from the original conntrack tuple leading to\nincorrect packet matching and potentially executing wrong actions\nin case this packet recirculates within the datapath or goes back\nto userspace.\n\nND fields should not be accessed in non-ND packets, so not clearing\nthem should be fine.  Executing memset() only for actual ND packets to\navoid the issue.\n\nInitializing the whole thing before parsing is needed because ND packet\nmay not contain all the options.\n\nThe issue only affects the OVS_PACKET_CMD_EXECUTE path and doesn't\naffect packets entering OVS datapath from network interfaces, because\nin this case CT metadata is populated from skb after the packet is\nalready parsed.",

Instead, the change is\ndeferred until the next instance of the interrupt being triggered on the\noriginal CPU.\n\nWhen the interrupt next triggers on the original CPU, the new affinity is\nenforced within __irq_move_irq(). A vector is allocated from the new CPU,\nbut the old vector on the original CPU remains and is not immediately\nreclaimed. Instead, apicd->move_in_progress is flagged, and the reclaiming\nprocess is delayed until the next trigger of the interrupt on the new CPU.\n\nUpon the subsequent triggering of the interrupt on the new CPU,\nirq_complete_move() adds a task to the old CPU's vector_cleanup list if it\nremains online. Subsequently, the timer on the old CPU iterates over its\nvector_cleanup list, reclaiming old vectors.\n\nHowever, a rare scenario arises if the old CPU is outgoing before the\ninterrupt triggers again on the new CPU.\n\nIn that case irq_force_complete_move() is not invoked on the outgoing CPU\nto reclaim the old apicd->prev_vector because the interrupt isn't currently\naffine to the outgoing CPU, and irq_needs_fixup() returns false. Even\nthough __vector_schedule_cleanup() is later called on the new CPU, it\ndoesn't reclaim apicd->prev_vector; instead, it simply resets both\napicd->move_in_progress and apicd->prev_vector to 0.\n\nAs a result, the vector remains unreclaimed in vector_matrix, leading to a\nCPU vector leak.\n\nTo address this issue, move the invocation of irq_force_complete_move()\nbefore the irq_needs_fixup() call to reclaim apicd->prev_vector, if the\ninterrupt is currently or used to be affine to the outgoing CPU.\n\nAdditionally, reclaim the vector in __vector_schedule_cleanup() as well,\nfollowing a warning message, although theoretically it should never see\napicd->move_in_progress with apicd->prev_cpu pointing to an offline CPU.",

The issue stems from the size of one of the structs that the code checks, the wmfw_adsp?_sizes struct, which can vary depending on whether the firmware used is ADSP1 or ADSP2 and Halo Core. In the second case, the wmfw_adsp2_sizes struct is 4 bytes longer, which can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to undefined behavior in the system. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat believes this flaw to be of moderate severity because successful exploitation of this vulnerability would require elevated privileges to be able to access/modify the firmware loading mechanism. It also presents an elevated attack complexity given that the attacker requires knowledge of the Cirrus Logic DSP firmware to be able to craft special firmware to exploit the buffer overflow. Finally, depending on when the vulnerability is executed (ex. at boot time or during runtime) the impact on the system might change drastically; in one scenario it might cause a kernel crash in another just the audio driver might stop working.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",

By manipulating sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove the initial messages on the secure channel without causing a MAC failure. For example, an attacker could disable the ping extension and thus disable the new countermeasure in OpenSSH 9.5 against keystroke timing attacks. \n            STATEMENT: This CVE is classified as moderate because the attack requires an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) who can intercept and modify the connection's traffic at the TCP/IP layer.\n\nAlthough the attack is cryptographically innovative, its security impact is fortunately quite limited. It only allows the deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this protocol stage prevents user authentication from proceeding, leading to a stalled connection.\n\nThe most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication begins.

By manipulating sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove the initial messages on the secure channel without causing a MAC failure. For example, an attacker could disable the ping extension and thus disable the new countermeasure in OpenSSH 9.5 against keystroke timing attacks. \n            STATEMENT: This CVE is classified as moderate because the attack requires an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) who can intercept and modify the connection's traffic at the TCP/IP layer.\n\nAlthough the attack is cryptographically innovative, its security impact is fortunately quite limited. It only allows the deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this protocol stage prevents user authentication from proceeding, leading to a stalled connection.\n\nThe most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke timing obfuscation features. However, there is no other observable impact on session secrecy or session integrity.\n            MITIGATION: Update to the last version and check that client and server provide kex pseudo-algorithms indicating usage of the updated version of the protocol which is protected from the attack. If \"kex-strict-c-v00@openssh.com\" is provided by clients and \"kex-strict-s-v00@openssh.com\" is in the server's reply, no other steps are necessary.\n\nDisabling ciphers if necessary:\n\nIf \"kex-strict-c-v00@openssh.com\" is not provided by clients or \"kex-strict-s-v00@openssh.com\" is absent in the server's reply, you can disable the following ciphers and HMACs as a workaround on RHEL-8 and RHEL-9:\n\n1. chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\n2. hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com\n3. hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com\n4. hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com\n5. hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com\n\nTo do that through crypto-policies, one can apply a subpolicy with the following content:\n```\ncipher@SSH = -CHACHA20-POLY1305\nssh_etm = 0\n```\ne.g., by putting these lines into `/etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/CVE-2023-48795.pmod`, applying the resulting subpolicy with `update-crypto-policies --set $(update-crypto-policies --show):CVE-2023-48795` and restarting openssh server.\n\nOne can verify that the changes are in effect by ensuring the ciphers listed above are missing from both `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config` and `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config`.\n\nFor more details on using crypto-policies, please refer to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening\n\nNote that this procedure does limit the interoperability of the host and is only suggested as a temporary mitigation until the issue is fully resolved with an update.\n\nFor RHEL-7: \nWe can recommend to use strict MACs and Ciphers on RHEL7 in both files /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n\nBelow strict set of Ciphers and MACs can be used as mitigation for RHEL 7.\n\n```\nCiphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com\nMACs umac-64@openssh.com,umac-128@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512\n```\n\n- For Openshift Container Platform 4:\nPlease refer the KCS[1] document for verifying the fix in RHCOS.\n\n[1] https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7071748",
